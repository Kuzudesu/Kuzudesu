- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kuzudesu
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
Making cool stuff! This happens to include coding and projects!
I happen to like anime, video games, music, and geek culture!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
A lot of game designing principles. In academic terms I'm about to finish
my Associates in Science for Computer Science. This isn't nearly as impressive
once you realize I spent most of that time on General Education, which has been 
by far the biggest waste of my time. Just feels good to finally be done with that
portion hahah.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
Any project that involves networking or self containted projects to help me grow
my skillset. I'm a teamplayer and will work intensively with anyone who is willing
to take me under their team.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
By email is the best way!
